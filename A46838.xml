            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the life of righteousness, walk with the Lord and keep your minds stayed on him in all things, in the measure of his eternal spirit which he hath revealed in you, to guide your feet in the path of life that the eye of your understandings being kept open, you may see that which is eternal and press after it, to put on his righteousnesse as a garment and to be cloathed with humility, that his fear may possesse your hearts and therein you may watch against every assault of the Adversary of your souls everlasting wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>

            <p>For this my dear friends you will find, that the enemy will strongly work (at after convincement and a pretious tast of the word of truth) to draw out the mind again into visible things, from the invisible God of Heaven and Earth, and will present the glory of this world, and what might have been attained therein, if the way of truth had not been walked in; and here if the watch be not kept, and the fear of the Lord dwels in, that the eye of the understanding be kept open, to see, weigh, and discern with the word of truth the end, emptiness and vanity of all these things, hard it will be for such to keep him out from entring the heart again with his subtile baits, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning temptations notwithstanding all that hath been known and professed; and if the counsel of the wicked one be entertained, and he get an entrance into the heart again with these things, then that eye will be opened which will watch for evil and not for good, and waite for the halting of others, and discontent will arise, and murmurings and grudgings secretly in the heart, and the Lord will be departed from, and <hi>Aegypt</hi> again will be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged after, with the flesh-pots thereof, the Onions and the Garlick, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding enjoyments of this present world, which will perish in a moment and come to naught, and the heart continually will be lusting after them, and no beauty nor comliness will be seen in the Lord of life, nor his pretious truth, nor in them that walk therein, but there will be a wholly departing back again into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> spiritually in heart and mind, and the nature and spirt, of this world will arise again, and a desire to be great and esteemed the<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And so my dear friends you may read me, in these things, and you that have been or are tempted in this kind, watch against the Adversary and walk in Gods fear continually, that a dayly crosse ye may know to the nature and spirit of the world, that by it they may be crucified and the ground thereof destroyed, that the wicked one may never enter nor prevail against you in any wise, through his subtile baits and cunning temptations of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry riches or pleasure of this present world which passeth away, or any other visible thing or outward enjoyment which will perish and come to naught, to draw out your minds from the Lord, and divert your feet from the path of life, or to cool your love fervency and zeal towards the Lord and his preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truth, or one towards another therein; for all these things shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45635:3"/> but the word of the Lord abideth for ever, in which ye are called to seek after those enjoyments, treasures and delights which perisheth not; and to obtain an everlasting Inheritance, riches and possessions that enduers for ever, in the world without end: And therefore my dear friends be valiant for the Lord and his Truth upon earth, and keep your minds single to God in all things, giving up unto him in whatsoever he calls to, that he may be glorified in you in body soul and spirit and in your earthly substance, being freely offered up unto him a sacrifice in his will which is but your reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble service that your hearts may stand approved in his sight in all things, in doing or in suffering according to his will, and herein will your souls find peace, and heavenly rejoycing that man cannot take away, nor no mortal can deprive you of, and the powerful Arme of Almighty God will reveal it self in you from day to day, and manifest his strength in your weakness, to bear you up and carry you through every tryal or exercise, whether as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward man, and he will be your everlasting reward in all, and a present help in the time of need to give you victory over every assault of the wicked one as in uprightness of heart you give up to him abideing in the word of faith, for he is faithful that hath promised, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee;</hi> so that we may boldly say the Lord is our helper, yea he is become our strength and the Rock of our Salvation, and therefore we shall not be moved; he is become our everlasting Inheritance, riches and possession, the lifter up of our heads our rejoycing all the day long, and the portion of our cup for evermore; And therefore we will not fear what man can do unto us, nor what man take from us or deprive us of, but in the name of the Lord will we go through all, and by the word of his patience shall we be enabled to hear all, endure all and suffer all what ever shall be done, to us, or inflicted upon us for his truths sake, and in his strength, power and might will we break through all, the tribulations afflictions and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this present time, or what ever else would hinder us in the way from following the Lamb in faithfulness, or seperate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus; Be it principalities or powers, spiritual wickedness in high places, or the Rulers and Prince of darkness, through his many instruments in this world, yet over all shall we be made more then Conquerers through faith in him that hath loved us, who hath begotten us to himself, and hath quickned living breathings and desires in our hearts to seek after and be made heirs of that kingdome and the righteousness thereof, where Sathan hath no part, nor the Prince of this world hath no dominion but is cast out for ever and shut up in utter darkness and his Angles with him from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his throne, where our souls shall rejoyce and shall magnifie his name for ever and ever, when this world shal

And my dear friends, give not way unto that which would beget into offences one against another, or take liberty to thy self because of anothers weakness or infirmity, but you that stand take heed least you fall; and if any see his brother overtaken in a fault, go and tell him and restore such an one with the spirit of meekness, considering thy self least thou also be tempted, and give not way unto that which would entertain an offence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy mind against the truth and them that live therein, because of such a thing for that which speaks evil of the truth, or them that walk therein, or would lead to take more Liberty (as to the fleshly part) because of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in another its not of God, but of the Enemy and therefore to be judged and denyed by all; For all are not Israel who are of Israel, nor are all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light. (and converted unto God) who are convinced by it, but such as walk in it, are born of it, and are guided by it in all things, such are children of the Light and of the day, and there is none occasion of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in them: And so my deay freinds in singleness of heart walk with the Lord and be faithful to him, in what ever you are convinced of, by the measure of his spirit, that as ye have beleived in, and received of Christ Iesus the light of Life, even so ye may walk in him, rooted and built up a spiritual Habitation for him to dwell in, that of his fulness ye may receive even grace for grace to grow up in him, approving your hearts in all things as in his sight, of whom you must receive your reward. And let not the failing nor falling of another turn ye aside from the way of truth, and divert thy feet from the path of Life, for to his own master must he stand or fall, and of him also must receive a reward according to his doings, and blessed are such as are not offended in the Lord nor at his way of truth, because of the failings or falling of others, (who once might have been convinced by it) but fall from it, having lov'd this present world, and so turne from the grace and truth of God into wantonness or other snare of the wicked one, but such make not the truth void, nor the grace of God of none effect to them that walk therein, and reteine their integrity but must bear their own bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and receive their Iudgment of God in the day of account, and those that in faithfulness run the race set before them, and persevere unto the end, shall in no wise lose their reward. And these things my freinds you may meet withal in the way, and the spirit of the World, come again to tempt you in your spiritual passage to the Land of rest, and therefore you had need to watch on every hand and to take up the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And my dear freinds these things was upon me, to give forth amongst you, at this present time, as a warning unto some that they be not otherwise minded, giving way to the spirit of this world, which will lead into flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Liberty, after the pleasures, riches, or delights of this present world which will perish and come to nought, and so blind the eye of the mind, which should see that which is eternal and press after, it even the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdome riches and inheritance prepared for all those that in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness persevere unto the end. And you my dear freinds watching in Gods light will see these things and the ground and appearance thereof, and the end of every thing that presents it self unto you, and from whence it ariseth; and dwelling in his fear that sheweth the evil, in the thought ground or conception, it will teach you to eschew the evil, and to crush, subdue, and mortifie every desire that is earthly sensual and of the nature of the world, and to bring into Captivity every high thought into the obedience of Christ and to learn him in all things, his Cross humiliation and sufferings, and to put him on who is not of this world, his nature his life and righteousness in whom the tempter hath no part, and here you will come to see your loss of any thing in this world to be your gain unto life eternal, and he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an everlasting inheritance unto you, riches treasure and a possession that none can take from you, and his strength wisdome and glory will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest it self in you, and his righteousness be your covering, and the joy of his salvation spring up in your hearts from day to day which will counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile all your sufferings, ye and superabound all the tribulations of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time, and be your delight and continual consolation, that none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive you of, ye the reproaches of this world, for him and his truth sake will be as a crown of joy and Heavenly rejoycing set upon your heads, &amp; true thanksgiving everlasting Psalms of prayse, will arise in your hearts unto the Lord, who hath counted you worthy not only to beleive but also to suffer for his name sake, having begotten you to himself by his word of Truth which abideth in your hearts, and the spirit of glory and supplication, will rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, in all your sufferings and be as a welspring of life arising in you, and springing up unto life eternal as an earnest of your inheritance unto the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
